# Bidirectional-Visitor-Counter-with-Metal-Detection
This project implements a bidirectional visitor counter system with metal detection using **Arduino UNO Board**. The system is designed to count the number of people entering and exiting a specific area while also detecting the presence of metal objects.

### Key Features:  
**1. Visitor Counting:** The system accurately counts the number of people entering and exiting a designated area, providing bidirectional counting capabilities.  
**2. Metal Detection:** It incorporates metal detection functionality to identify the presence of metal objects carried by individuals passing through the area.  
**3. Real-time Monitoring:** The counter updates in real-time, allowing users to monitor the current visitor count and metal detection status.  
**4. User-friendly Interface:** The system displays the count of the people inside the hall/room using an LCD display.  
**5. Data Logging:** It logs the visitor count and metal detection data, enabling data analysis and insights.

This project combines hardware components, including sensors and an Arduino board. The metal detection is achieved using appropriate metal sensing modules or circuits.

Feel free to explore the project and adapt it to your specific needs. The code and poster can be found in the project repository.

*Enjoy counting and detecting visitors with this bidirectional visitor counter with metal detection system!*
